Alaric Stark, named after the legendary King in the North, stands as the living embodiment of his noble lineage. Born to Lord Eddard Stark 
and Lady Catelyn Tully, he shares a unique bond with his twin, Bran. Instead of jesting at Arya, Alaric chose to be her steadfast ally,
practicing swordplay together and forming an unbreakable bond.
Trained by his elder brothers Robb and Jon, Alaric developed into a formidable fighter, his skills honed on the foundations of loyalty 
and family. His undying devotion to the Starks is evident in his readiness to lay down his life for their cause, a testament to the 
enduring strength of House Stark. In times of peril, Alaric remains an unwavering shield for his kin, embodying the essence of honor, 
duty, and familial love within the storied halls of Winterfell.





Rhaenyra Targaryen, her violet eyes ablaze with an indomitable spirit, emerges as the resolute and spirited younger sister of Daenerys. 
Six years her junior, Rhaenyra carries a fervent determination to restore the tarnished name of Targaryen to its former glory. Possessing
the rare gift of being a true blood, impervious to flame, she stands as a living testament to the ancient Targaryen lineage. Her dragon,
named in honor of Syrax, soars alongside her, the embodiment of their shared quest to reshape the destiny of Westeros and revive the 
greatness of House Tragaryen.


Seraphina Lannister, the legendary lioness, stands as the fierce guardian of House Lannister\'s ancestral pride, her ferocity resonating 
through the ages. Younger than Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion, her loyalty and fearsome protection make her an indomitable force within the 
golden halls of Casterly Rock. Cherished by all, Seraphina\'s beauty rivals Cersei\'s, yet her intellect and insatiable thirst for knowledge 
mirror Tyrion\'s own. It is in this brotherly bond with Tyrion that her true strength lies, an unbreakable connection that transcends the 
complexities of the Lannister legacy, marking her as both a captivating beauty and a formidable mind within the lion\'s den.


Brystan Baratheon, the clandestine legacy forged in the shadows, is the legitimate and eldest son of Robert Baratheon, a master smith 
and warrior renowned for crafting the Baratheon path. Born of a secret union with Lady Elara Stark, a distant cousin sought after the 
tragic death of Lyanna Stark, their love was shrouded in magic and secrecy. Elara, carrying the weight of this clandestine bond, gave 
birth to Brystan before meeting her untimely end. Hidden from even the knowledge of Ned Stark, Brystan\'s existence intertwines with the 
complexities of love, loss, and the veiled history of House Baratheon.
